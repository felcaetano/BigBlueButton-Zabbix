- Listeners. Participants who connected to audio stream in the "listen only" mode. They can do everything a viewers can, plus listen other participants, who have mic;
- Speakers. Participants who connect to audio stream with using voice feature. They can do everything a listeners can, plus talk to other participants thru microphone;
- Broadcasters. Participants who uses Webcam. They can do everything a viewers can, plus broadcast video stream to other participants;
- Moderators. Superusers in the conference. They can do everything a participants can, and something else. A moderator can mute/unmute other viewers, lock down viewers (such as restrict them from using private chat), and make anyone the current presenter.

1. Add string ``UserParameter=bbb.miner[*],curl -s https://bbb.example.com/bigbluebutton/api/$1?checksum=`echo -n "$1BigBlueButtonSecretStringThere" | sha1sum |  head -c 40` 2>&1`` to the end of your ``zabbix_agentd.conf`` file;
2. Replace **bbb.example.com** with your BBB server hostname which used for the SSL-certificate
3. Replace **BigBlueButtonSecretStringThere** with your BBB server secret. You can get it from ``bbb-conf --secret`` command output;
4. Restart Zabbix agent;
